This directory contains my assignment submissions in the course CS202A (2021-22 II Sem.) in a team of two. The course covered topics relevant to Mathematical Logic.

+ [<u>Assignment 1</u>](./Assignment1/)- The assignment was about encoding the problem of solving a sudoku pair into a SAT (satisfiability) problem, and then using a SAT solver to solve the pair-sudoku puzzle.<br>
<t><i>We were given a bonus +5 marks (out of 100) in Assignment 1 with the comment-<br></i>
> Bonus marks (+5) given since the solution seems to be working perfectly and [the report](./Assignment1/Report.pdf) is nicely written.

+ [<u>Assignment 2</u>](./Assignment2/)- The assignment was about implementing a SAT solver that could operate on CNF formulas given in DIMACS format. We were free to choose any algorithm and programming language. We implemented the standard [DPLL Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPLL_algorithm) in `C++` with some branching heuristics.<br>
<i>We were awarded 80 marks (out of 100). 20 marks were reserved for those whose solvers could solve some benchmarks under 1 hour.<br> Our solver did however, pass the uuf150 benchmarks (~2 minutes).</i>
