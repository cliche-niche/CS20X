## Commands

The command used to run the python files on

### Windows
```
python Q3.py
python Q4.py
```

### Linux
```bash
python3 Q3.py
python3 Q4.py
```

## Dependencies
Both python files ([Q3](./Q3.py) as well as [Q4](./Q4.py)) require `random` and `matplotlib`. So please make sure these are functioning. 
Additionally, they use `dark_background` plot style. In case it is not working/not found, please comment that line out.

## Tex
The latex file was compiled on Overleaf and used four PNG's, three of which were plots produced by the program (included in the submission), and the fourth was IIT-K logo, which has not been included. In case there is an error due to it, please comment that part.
