This directory contains my assignment submissions in the course CS203B (2021-22 II Sem.). The course covered topics relevant to Probability Theory. As an extra topic, we were taught 

+ [<u>Assignment 1</u>](./Assignment1/)- The assignment had questions based mainly on Conditional Probability and Bayes' Theorem. One question was based on the [CLT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem).<br>
The directory contains a [PDF](./Assignment1/Assignment.pdf) file containing my solutions, a [python file](./Assignment1/main.py) which contains the program for the 4<sup>th</sup> question and a README file. The `PDF` also contains some plots which were made by the [program](./Assignment1/main.py).<br>
